<h1>PS2</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>PS/2 device controller provides basic timing control for PS/2 communication. All communication
between the device and the host is managed through the CLK and DATA pins. Unlike PS/2
keyboard or mouse device controller, the received/transmit code needs to be translated as
meaningful code by firmware. The device controller generates the CLK signal after receiving a
request to send, but host has ultimate control over communication. DATA sent from the host to
the device is read on the rising edge and DATA sent from device to the host is change after rising
edge. A 16 bytes FIFO is used to reduce CPU intervention. S/W can select 1 to 16 bytes for a
continuous transmission. </li>
