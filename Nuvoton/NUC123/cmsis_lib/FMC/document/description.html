<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The NuMicro NUC123 is equipped with 68/36 K bytes on-chip embedded flash for application
program memory (APROM) and data flash that can be updated through ISP procedure. In System
Programming (ISP) function enables user to update chip embedded flash when chip is soldered
on PCB. After chip is powered on, Cortex-M0 CPU fetches code from APROM or LDROM
decided by boot select (CBS) in Config0. By the way, NuMicro? NUC123 also provides data flash
for user, to store some application dependent data before chip power off.
The NuMicro? NUC123 supports another flexible feature: configurable data flash size. The data
flash size is decided by data flash variable size enable (DFVSEN), data flash enable (DFEN) in
Config0 and data flash base address (DFBADR) in Config1. When DFVSEN is set to 1, the data
flash size is fixed at 4K and the address is started from 0x0001_f000, and the APROM size is
become 64/32K. When DFVSEN is set to 0 and DFEN is set to 1, the data flash size is zero and
the APROM size is 68/36K bytes.. When DFVSEN is set to 0 and DFEN is set to 0, the APROM
and data flash share 68/36K bytes continuous address and the start address of data flash is
defined by (DFBADR) in Config1.</li>
