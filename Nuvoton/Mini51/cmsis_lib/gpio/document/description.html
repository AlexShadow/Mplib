<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>There are 30 General Purpose I/O pins shared with special feature functions in this MCU. 
        The 30 pins are arranged in 6 ports named with P0, P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5. Each one of the
        30 pins is independent and has the corresponding register bits to control the pin mode 
        function and data. The I/O type of each of I/O pins can be independently software configured
        as input, output, open-drain, or quasi-bidirectional mode. After reset, the I/O type of all
        pins stay in input mode and port data register Px_DOUT[n] resets to “1”. For Quasi bi-direction
        mode, each I/O pin equips a very weakly individual pull-up resistor which is about 110KΩ~300KΩ
        for VDD is from 5.0V to 2.5V.
