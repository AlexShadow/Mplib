<h1>SPI</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial data communication protocol which 
        operates in full duplex mode. Devices communicate in master/slave mode with 4-wire bi-direction 
        interface. NuMicro Mini51â„¢ series contain one set of SPI controller performing a serial-to-parallel 
        conversion on data received from a peripheral device, and a parallel-to-serial conversion on data 
        transmitted to a peripheral device. SPI controller can be set as a master,it also can be set as a 
        slave controlled by an off-chip master device.
