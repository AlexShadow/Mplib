<h1>PWM</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NuMicro Mini51â„¢ series has built-in one PWM unit which function is specially designed
         for motor driving control applications.The PWM unit supports 6 PWM Generators which
         can be configured as 6 independent PWM outputs,PWM0~PWM5,or as 3 complementary PWM
         pairs,(PWM0,PWM1),(PWM2,PWM3) and (PWM4,PWM5) with 3 programmable dead-zone generators. 
         Each PWM Generator share the 8-bit prescaler,clock divider providing 5 divided frequencies
         (1,1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16).Each PWM output has independent 16-bit counter for PWM period control, 
         and 16-bit comparators for PWM duty control.The 6 PWM Generators provide six independent 
         PWM interrupt flags which are set by hardware when the corresponding PWM period counter 
         comparison matched.Each PWM interrupt source with its corresponding enable bit can cause to 
         request PWM interrupt.The PWM Generators can be configured as one-shot mode to produce
         only one PWM cycle signal or auto-reload mode to output PWM waveform continuously.
