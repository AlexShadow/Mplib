<h1>I2C</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I2C is a two-wire, bi-directional serial bus that provides a simple and 
        efficient method of data exchange between devices. The I2C standard is 
        a true multi-master bus including collision detection and arbitration 
        that prevents data corruption if two or more masters attempt to control 
        the bus simultaneously.Serial,8-bit oriented  bi-directional data transfers
        can be made up 1.0 Mbps.Data is transferred between a Master and a Slave 
        synchronously to SCL on the SDA line on a byte-by-byte basis.Each data byte
        is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for each data bit with the MSB
        being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each transferred byte.
        Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL,therefore,the SDA line
        may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable 
        during the high period of SCL.A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high
        is interpreted as a command (START or STOP). Please refer to the following 
        figure for more detail I2C BUS Timing.
