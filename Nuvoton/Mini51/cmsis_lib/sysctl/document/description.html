<h1>SysCtl</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The following functions are included in system manager section System Memory Map 
        System Timer (SysTick),Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller(NVIC),System management
        registers for product ID System management registers for chip and module functional
        reset and multi-function pin control,Brownout and chip miscellaneous Control Register 
        Combined peripheral interrupt source identify.The clock controller generates the clocks
        for the whole chip,including system clocks and all peripheral clocks.The clock controller
        also implements the power control function with the individually clock ON/OFF control, 
        clock source selection and a 4-bit clock divider.The chip will not enter power-down mode
        until CPU sets the power down enable bit(PWR_DOWN_EN) and Cortex-M0 core executes the WFI
        instruction. After that, chip enter power-down mode and wait for wake-up interrupt source 
        triggered to leave  power-down mode.In the power down mode,the clock controller turns off
        the external crystal and internal 22.1184 MHz oscillator to reduce the overall system power
        consumption.
