<h1>ADC</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    The TMPM370 FY contains two 12-bit successive-approximation analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).
    The ADC unit A (ADC A) has 15 analog inputs. Six inputs are able to use for shunt resistor currents of
    motor 0. Three of six inputs are connected with operational amp/ comparator outputs. Thus twelve
    inputs can use for external input.
</ul>
<ul>
    The ADC unit B (ADC B) has 17 analog inputs. Six inputs are able to use for shunt resistor currents of
    motor 0. And two inputs are able to use for shut resistor currents of motor 1. four of eight inputs are
    connected with operational amp/ comparator outputs. Thus thirteen inputs can use for external input.
    Twenty two external analog input pins (AINA0 to AINA8, AINA9/AINB0, AINA10/AINB1,
    AINA11/AINB2, AINB3 to AINB12) can also be used as input/output ports.
