<h1>ADC</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>TMPM369FDXBG contain two units of 12-bit sequential-conversion analog/digital converters (ADC) with 16 analog
input channels.These 16 analog input channels (AINA0 to AINA3, AINB0 to AINB11) are also used as input/output ports.
There are two operation modes: one is the single unit mode operation, in which each unit operate separately,
and the other is the dual unit mode, in which the interleave control circuit (ADCINTLV) generates trigger signals
for AD conversion performed by two AD conversion units.</li>
</ul>
