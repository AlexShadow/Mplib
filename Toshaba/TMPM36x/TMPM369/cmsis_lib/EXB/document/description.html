<h1>EXB</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>There are two types of exceptions: those that are generated when some error condition occurs or when an instruction
to generate an exception is executed; and those that are generated by hardware, such as an interrupt request signal
from an external pin or peripheral function</li>
</ul>
