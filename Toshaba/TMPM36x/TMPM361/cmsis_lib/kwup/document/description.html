<h1>KWUP</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The TMPM361FYFG has four key inputs, KWUP0  to KWUP3. They can be used as interrupts for waking up from STOP mode or normal external interrupts. The four inputs share a single interrupt source (INTKWUP), which needs to  be set in the clock generator (CG) block. KWUP0 to KWUP3 can be enabled or disabl ed individually in the <KEYEN> bit of the KWUP control register (KWUPCRn).  
	The active state of each KWUP input can  be selected in the KWUPCRn<KEY> bits from rising edge, falling edge, both edges, High level and Low level.  
	All interrupt requests can be cleared by setti ng the KWUP interrupt all clear register (KWUPCLR)  in an interr upt service routine.  
	Each KWUP input pin has a pull-up, which c an individually be configured as static or dynamic in the KWUPCRn<DPE> bit.  </li>
