<h1>CAN</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Compliant with CAN version 2.0 B ;
	Standard and extended formats supported;
	Data frames and remote frames supported for each format ;
	32 Mailboxes (31 receive & transmit  ? 1 receive-only); 
	CAN bus baud rate up to 1 Mbps (with a system clock of at least 48 MHz) ;
	Bit timing parameter equivalent to Intel 82527 ;
	Baud rate prescaler built in ;
	The order in which messages are transmitted  can be selected from the following two types of internal arbitrations: 
	(1)  The mailbox with the lower number will be sent first ;
	(2)  The mailbox with the higher priority identifier will be sent first. 
	Time stamp function for receive and transmit messages Operation mode :
	(1)  Normal operation mode ;
	(2) Configuration mode ;
	(3)  Sleep mode: Can wake up with CAN bus active state detection (at WUBA  =  1) or a write access to the master control register MCR. 
	(4)  Suspend mode: Inactive state on the CAN bus ;
	(5)  Test loop back mode: Self acknowledge ;
	(6)  Test error mode: Writable error counters; 
	Message receive mask function for two systems :
	(1  Programmable global receive mask (common to mailboxes 0 to 30) ;
	(2)  Programmable local receive mask (for mailbox 31 only) .
	Receive mask bit for ID extension bit ;
	Interrupt signal :
	(1)  INTCANRX: CAN receive completion interrupt ;
	(2)  INTCANTX: CAN transmit completion interrupt ;
	(3)  INTCANGB: CAN global interrupt .
	(Interrupts from eight causes includi ng warning level, error passive, and bus-off interrupts) </li>
</ul>
