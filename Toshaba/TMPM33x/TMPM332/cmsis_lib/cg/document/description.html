<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The clock/mode control block enables to select clock gear,prescaler clock and warm-up of the PLL clock multi-plication circuit and oscillator.There is also the low power consumption mode which can reduce power consumption by mode transitions.This chapter describes how to control clock operating modes and mode transitions.The clock/mode control block has the following functions:
	Controls the system clock
	Controls the prescaler clock
	Controls the PLL multiplication circuit
	Controls the warm-up timer
	In addition to NORMAL mode, the TMPM332FWUG can operate in three types of low power mode to reduce power consumption according to its usage conditions.</li>
</ul>
